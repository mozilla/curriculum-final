            <li>At the end of the intervention, participants will have a better understanding of the different ways that they can use their smartphones to <strong>support their livelihoods and improve their lives</strong>. They will have learned the full potential of their device.</li>
            <li>At the end of the intervention, participants will feel some <strong>ownership</strong> over the content that they have discussed and outlined together. We will curate <strong>their ideas</strong> and examples into a curriculum that can be published online.</li>

            <h1>A Different Kind of Intervention</h1>
            <div class="time"></div>
            
            <h2>Why is it different?</h2>
            
            <p>Since we <strong>don’t have all the answers</strong> about how to hustle with your phone, we need to crowdsource them.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What does crowdsource mean?</strong> When you crowdsource something, you find a solution by drawing from a lot of ideas from a lot of people. The “crowd” of people gives you your answer.</p>
            
            <p>Since we want to see a <strong>progression in the learning curve</strong>, we want to make this intervention a bit different and invite participants people to feel like they have reached a level good enough to teach each others. For example, participants should feel like they can teach their community how to leverage the potential of their smartphone after the intervention.</p>
            
            <h2>What is the new format?</h2>
            
            <p>Instead of teaching specific content, we will invite participants to reflect and find their own solution.>/p>
              
            <p>We are designing a workshop which invites people to be creative and to collaborate.</p>
              
            <p>While we are inviting participants to find their own solutions, <strong>we will provide a lot of helpful materials, processes, and advice</strong> to them so they don’t feel overwhelmed at first.</p>
            
            <h2>What are the deliverables?</h2>
            
            <p>Each [participant/group/site] will leave with a list of tips, lessons, examples and ideas about how to hustle with your phone, how to make your life more productive, and how to use the smartphone to find solutions to your problems. THE FULL POTENTIAL.</p>
            
            <p>We will combine that list into a final curriculum that we can then publish.</p>
