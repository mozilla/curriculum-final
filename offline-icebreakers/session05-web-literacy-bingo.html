          <li>
            <h1>Preparation</h1>

            <p>Create a bingo card that aligns with your web literacy goals for an event. The example here shows a bingo card created to help learners discover the privacy practices of others in the room as part of the <a href="https://learning.mozilla.org/web-literacy">Web Literacy Map</a>.</p>

            <p>Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8-imyESVQ_8lpNd0zJCD0EXc9fBVWI_7iZsncK_EDQ/edit#">another example that uses web literacy habits</a>.</a>

            <img src="http://gdurl.com/bk92" width="90%" alt="An image of a bingo card with a web literacy topic or statements in each box"><br><br>

            <p>Be creative in designing your own bingo card. An alternative to the privacy example above could incude identifying file formats like .jpg, .svg, or .html or tags like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> that are a part of building a website and writing the web.</p>

            <p>Print enough copies and make enough chips or other markers for your participants to play bingo.</p>

          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Activity</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

            <p>Distribute bingo cards and chips (or pens) to participants.</p>

            <p>Have participants meet others in the room to collect signatures and collect one fact per square. That is to say, let players mingle and talk with one another until they can each find at least one person who can explain each item, theme, or topic in a bingo square. Anyone who successfuly explains an item can only sign another player's bingo once. This means that participants have to talk with at least 5 other players to collect enough explanations to get bingo.</p>

            <p>For example, participant Susan Doe may sign the bottom left square with her first name and note that she remembers a news story about wifi sniffing from the past year where "bad actors" intercepted someone's web traffic by monitoring and attacking a wifi network.</p>

            <p>Ask participants to call out "Bingo!" when they have a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line on the card. You can also challenge participants to fill the whole card.</p>

            <p>Award small prizes to players who get bingo or fill the entire card. Stickers make for great prizes, as do buttons and other simple forms of recognition!</p>

          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>

            <p>Faciliate a group discussion using a Bingo card answer key. if you created an answer key for your bingo card, you can use it to prompt discussion. Here's a link for <a href="http://gdurl.com/aQ6p/download">downloading the privacy bingo card answer key</a>. You can also use the discussion questions listed here. To prepare to facilitate the discussion, you may choose to do some research if any of the terms are unfamiliar.</p>

            <p>Possible prompts and questions for discussion include:</p>

            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>What do you think are the essential questions we should ask and answer about the web and online privacy?</li>
              <li>What kinds of experiences have people had with privacy?</li>
              <li>Why would someone want to be anonymous online?</li>
              <li>Why do you think stores sometimes ask for email addresses?</li>
              <li>Why do some people untag themselves in online photos? When would you untag yourself from a photo?</li>
              <li>What surprised you during the activity?</li>
              <li>After playing web literacy bingo, are you going to change any of your online habits? Why or why not?</li>
            </ul>
