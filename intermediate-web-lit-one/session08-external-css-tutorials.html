            <h1>2. Selecting Favorite Foods</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">25 minutes</div>

            <p>
              Welcome learners to today's activity and explain that we'll be using online, game-like CSS tutorials to learnnew ways to organize webpages and style their elements.
            </p>

            <p>
              First. we're going to practice sorting our favorite foods using multiple, overlapping categories as a way to conceptualize using multiple, specific CSS selectors all at once. Then we'll try to fit all of our favorite foods on to a plat using flexible layout as a way to think of the principles behind the <code>flexbox</code> layout properties we'll learn in one of today's tutorials.
            </p>

            <p>
              Invite learners to share their favorite foods with the class. Make a visible list on a large piece of paper, a whiteboard, or a shared document on your projected computer. Try to come up with a large list in under five minutes.
            </p>

            <p>Once you have a list of several foods, ask learners how they would select as many alike foods as possible using a mix of general and specific labels. How could they capture several foods at once with just a handul of selectors (or descriptions)? Start with 'Food' as an umbrella category and then asl learners to come up with a handful of selectors that describe as many favorite foods as possible.</p>

            <p>For example, if learners came up with a list like this...</p>

            <ul class="fancy">
              <li><code>Chocolate bars</code></li>
              <li><code>Orange chicken</code></li>
              <li><code>Potato chips (or crisps</code>)</li>
              <li><code>Edamame</code></li>
              <li><code>Mofongo</code></li>
            </ul>

            <p>...you might all together come up with a series of selectors like <code>food sweet</code> to cover <code>chocolate bars</code>, <code>mofongo</code>, and <code>orange chicken</code> and another series of selectors like <code>food not-meat savory</code> to cover <code>potato chips (or crisps)</code> and <code>edamame</code>.</p>

            <p>
              Have learners generate several series of selectors or ways to categorize several foods at once. Take up to 10 minutes for this part of the activity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once once you have 5 or more series of selectors, pass out the <a href="https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/28131/">empty plate template</a>. Ask learners to pick their favorite series of selectors and to fit all the foods inside of it on the plate. Also ask learners to label their plates with their series of selectors. Tell them that the idea is to think of the plate as a webpage and the arrangement of their foods as the layout of that page.
            </p>

            <p>
              <a href="https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/28131/"><img src="images/empty-plate.png" width="90%" alt="An image of an empty plate"></a>
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, ask learners to post their plates in a shared space in the classroom and to see how their peers arranged their foods on thier plates according to the available space and the food selectors they used for the activity. Accompany learners on a brief gallery walk before they take their seats at computers.
            </p>

          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>3. Playing the Tutorials</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">30 minutes</div>

            <p>After learners settle at their computers, introduce them to today's tutorials on your projected computer and make sure every learner can get to both sites.</p>

            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>CSS Diner - <a href="http://flukeout.github.io/">http://flukeout.github.io/</a></li>
              <li>Flexbox Froggy - <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/">http://flexboxfroggy.com/</a></li>
              <li>Flexbox Defense = <a href="http://www.flexboxdefense.com/">http://www.flexboxdefense.com/</a></li>
            </ul>

              <p>Explain that today's we'll look at how we can use CSS to select very specific parts of a page for styling, as well as to select multiple parts of a page at once. We'll also play around with <code>flexbox</code> layout selectors which can help us make flowing, dynamic (or flexible) layouts that are difficult to do with other positioning properties.</p>

            <p>
              Briefly work through a few levels of each tutorial on a projected computer to demo they work. Invite learners to come up with solutions for the early levels of the games. Then let learners work alone or in pairs for about a half hour. Tell them that the goal is to make it through both tutorials in that time, but that there will be places where each of us gets stuck - it's not a problem to ask for help or to run out of time today.
            </p>
          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>4. Reflection and Assessment</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>

            <p>After working through the tutorial, bring learners back together as a group and facilitate a brief, reflective conversation about today's work. Make a list of your own questions or ask questions like those suggested below.</p>

            <p>If you have time, consider asking learners to write, type, or otherwise record their responses for self-assessment and teacher evaluation. Just be sure to match recording technologies to learners' needs so that whatever medium (or media) you chose for (or with) the group isn't a barrier to learners' expression.</p>

            <ol class="fancy">
              <li>How are <code>float</code> and <code>clear</code> similar to and different from other layout properties we've used like <code>position</code>?</li>
              <li>When might you use <code>float</code> as a layout technique instead of <code>position</code>?</li>
              <li>What are the advantages of having a unified design or layout instead of a scambled or random one?</li>
              <li>Can you think of times when you might want a more broken or seemingly disorganized layout?</li>
              <li>How did styling from the CSS stylesheet interact with the HTML elements on the webpage? What's the connection there? What seemed easiest or most difficult about today's work? Why?</li>
            </ol>
